#+TITLE: Ansible scripts to reproducibly setup Raspberry Pi

* Motivation

My Pi's SDCard went bust, and doesn't let it boot.  I could probably
salvage it, and try to get it to work. But, I'd rather have a
reproducible setup, that can be quickly put onto a newly flashed RPi
OS.

This repository aims to automate this configuration.
