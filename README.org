#+TITLE: Ansible scripts to reproducibly setup Raspberry Pi

* Motivation

My Pi's SDCard went bust, and doesn't let it boot.  I could probably
salvage it, and try to get it to work. But, I'd rather have a
reproducible setup, that can be quickly put onto a newly flashed RPi
OS.

This repository aims to automate this configuration.

* Setup to bootstrap this repo

** Install Ansible on host

Something like this should work, for installing ~ansible~

#+begin_src sh
  pip install --user ansible
#+end_src

** Setup ~/etc/hosts~ on host

Add an entry to point to the Raspberry Pi IP address to the
~/etc/hosts~ file.

#+begin_src text
  192.168.0.127 rpi.local
#+end_src

** Setup SSH keys

Set up password-less SSH login. See this document for [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/connection_details.html#setting-up-ssh-keys][help]], if required.

* Run the playbook!

#+begin_src sh
  ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
#+end_src
